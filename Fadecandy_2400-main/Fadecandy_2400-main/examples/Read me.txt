Hello, welcome to the anime opc.

To run this you will need pyhpythonton and also opc to view the animation. You will be able to find the file
 (https://github.com/RahalFerguson/the_project.git) "the_project/Fadecandy_2400-main/Fadecandy_2400-main/examples"
inside this folder as "The Final". After you open that before you run it you must keep it open on python and go back to
the GitHub link I have been provided above. Then must follow "the_project/Fadecandy_2400-main/Fadecandy_2400-main/simulator/bin/"
after you reach there according to what operating system you are using you must open the folder and run the OPC file.
if you don't do it you won't be able to watch the animation.

#about the code hidden and the way to fix it.
When you go through the OPC in the first place you will see there's a code that has been deactivated. That's the code
that I have been developed to the GUI of this. It works perfectly, but the issue that I have been doing not used that is
in the first place i have been developed the code and then built the GUI separately to ensure nothing will happen to the
Final code, when it has been fully developed and used in the final OPC I run into an issue that is I can't run the code
using "import time" instead of that I must "from time import sleep" if I use that I must change all the "time. sleep($$)" to
"sleep($$)" because to me it's impossible to change all those and align the code into to places with the left time I didn't
do that. But if you guys can, you can develop my file.

#about how to play.
The code you just need to run through python IDE, Pycharm or etc. also you must have a python above 3.0, this is only
compatible with python 3.0 and above. When the first animation starts it will continue to the next animation automatically.
However, after the 3rd animation (the line disparaging from middle to the left and then right side to the middle) there will
be a short break for a few seconds before it starts the next animation. When all the animations are completely done
"Process finished with exit code 0" text.
